# Contributing to Beacon

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Beacon! This is a family-oriented project, and every contribution helps families stay organized without spending a fortune.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Found something broken? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/asachs01/beacon/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) using the bug report template. Include as much detail as you can -- your Home Assistant version, browser, and device type all help narrow things down.

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea that would make Beacon better for your family? [Open a feature request](https://github.com/asachs01/beacon/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). We'd love to hear how you use Beacon and what would make it more useful.

### Submitting Changes

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** from `main` for your change (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. **Make your changes** (see the style guide below)
4. **Test** your changes locally
5. **Commit** with a clear message (see commit conventions below)
6. **Push** to your fork and open a **Pull Request**

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/beacon.git
cd beacon
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts a development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app will hot-reload as you make changes.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files land in the `dist/` directory.

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode** is enabled -- no `any` types unless truly unavoidable
- Use **functional components** with hooks (no class components)
- Prefer **named exports** over default exports
- Keep components focused -- if it's getting long, break it up

### CSS

- Use **CSS custom properties** (variables) for colors and theming
- Follow the existing theme structure in `src/styles/themes/`
- Support both light and dark modes

### File Organization

```
src/
  api/           # External API integrations (HA, AnyList)
  components/    # React components
  hooks/         # Custom React hooks
  styles/        # CSS and theme definitions
  types/         # TypeScript type definitions
```

### General Guidelines

- Keep it simple. Readable code is better than clever code.
- Add types. If you're writing a new component or hook, define its props/return types.
- Don't over-engineer. This is a family calendar, not a spacecraft.

## Commit Conventions
