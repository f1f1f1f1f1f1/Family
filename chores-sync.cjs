/**
 * Two-way sync between Family's chores and Google Tasks, one list per family
 * member (accessed through HA's `todo` integration — Family never talks to
 * Google's API directly).
 *
 * Runs in the add-on server (server.js), one pass at a time: on a timer, a
 * few seconds after a chore or completion changes, and on demand from the
 * Settings "Sync Now" button. It used to run in every open browser, which
 * stopped when no screen was open, re-polled Google once per open device per
 * minute, and let passes on different devices overlap — a task newly added
 * in Google Tasks could be imported as two chores.
 *
 * CHORES: each family member who has a list configured gets their own synced
 * copy of every chore assigned to them, as a task in THEIR list. A chore
 * assigned to two people (each with their own list) creates one task in each
 * person's list, completable independently — that's what preserves Family's
 * per-person completion tracking through a sync to a system that has no
 * concept of multiple assignees.
 *
 * ROUTINES are not synced. Google Tasks subtasks aren't visible through HA's
 * todo integration, and one task per routine step cluttered the lists.
 * Routine tasks created by earlier versions (tracked in
 * beacon_routine_sync_links) are removed from Google Tasks on the next pass.
 *
 * Chores reset automatically with no special "daily reset" logic: Family's
 * completion tracking is date-scoped (completions made today, in Home
 * Assistant's time zone), so once a new day starts a chore is "not completed"
 * on Family's side — the next pass compares that against what was last
 * pushed to the task and un-checks it, the same as any other change.
 *
 * New tasks added directly in someone's Google Tasks app are imported as
 * chores assigned to that member.
 *
 * Tasks carry nothing in their notes: they're matched by uid through the
 * link records below. If a link is lost, an unlinked task with the chore's
 * title in that member's list is adopted rather than imported as a new
 * chore. Earlier builds wrote a "[beacon-sync] chore_id:…" tag into each
 * task's notes; it's still recognized, and stripped on the next pass.
 *
 * Sync link records (beacon_chores_sync_links) track which task (by uid,
 * within that member's list) corresponds to which chore, plus the status
 * Family and the task last agreed on — that's what lets a pass tell a
 * genuine change apart from one it already applied.
