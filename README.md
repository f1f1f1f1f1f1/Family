## Skylight alternative — without the subscription

Skylight is a polished wall calendar that charges for hardware **and** locks meal planning, photos, and other family features behind Calendar Plus (~$79/year). Beacon is the self-hosted answer: run it as a Home Assistant add-on (or standalone), keep data on your network, and use any tablet you already own.

→ [Getting started](https://beacon-family-docs.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/welcome/) · [Beacon vs Skylight](https://beacon-family-docs.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/skylight-alternative/) · Install with the Home Assistant badge above

## Features

- **Weekly Calendar** -- Beautiful week view with color-coded family members; supports HA calendar entities and a built-in local calendar
- **Grocery & Shopping Lists** -- AnyList, Home Assistant Shopping List, and local list support
- **Task / Todo Lists** -- Home Assistant todo entities and local task lists with dashboard integration
- **Chore Tracking** -- Assign chores, track streaks, and celebrate completions with a family leaderboard
- **Music Controls** -- Control Music Assistant, Home Assistant media players, and browse playlists from the display
- **Photo Slideshow** -- Display family photos between interactions
- **AirPlay** -- Mirror an iPhone, iPad or Mac to the display, or play its music there (add-on only)
- **Timer / Countdown** -- On-screen timer for cooking, homework, and more
- **Screen Saver** -- Automatic screen saver with clock overlay
- **Weather** -- Real-time weather from your Home Assistant weather entity
- **8+ Themes** -- Skylight, Midnight, Midnight Light, Nord, Dracula, Monokai, Rose, Forest, and dark mode (automatic or manual)
- **Family Management** -- Per-member colors, calendar filtering, and PIN-based profiles
- **Meal Planning** -- Meal plan bar with weekly dinner overview
- **Standalone Docker** -- Run against Home Assistant Core without Supervisor

## Installation

### Home Assistant Add-on (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is the one-click button:

[![Add to Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ff1f1f1f1f1f1%2FFamily)

Or install manually:

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Add-ons > Add-on Store**
2. Click the overflow menu (**...**) and select **Repositories**
3. Add: `https://github.com/f1f1f1f1f1f1/Family`
4. Find **Family** in the store and click **Install** (Home Assistant builds it from this repository's root `Dockerfile`, compiling the AirPlay receiver as it does; it does not pull the standalone GHCR image). Supervisor rebuilds only after the add-on manifest version changes through semantic-release.
5. Leave `parent_pin` and `blocked_entities` blank for the default setup, or set an optional 6–8 digit parent PIN and a comma-separated list of HA entity IDs to block. Save, start the add-on, then click **Open Web UI** through Home Assistant ingress. Existing `allowed_entities` values from older versions are ignored; remove that obsolete option when editing the configuration.

> **Tip:** Enable **Show in sidebar** in the add-on's Info tab for a wall-mounted tablet. Sign in to Home Assistant on each display; the add-on is ingress-only, not available at a direct unauthenticated port.

### Standalone Docker (Home Assistant without Supervisor)

Choose a published `vX.Y.Z` tag from the [fork's GHCR package](https://github.com/f1f1f1f1f1f1/Family/pkgs/container/family). Images are published only for new releases after the image workflow is enabled; there is no `latest` tag. In an environment file **outside the repository** (restrict it to the container operator), set `HA_URL`, `HA_TOKEN` (a Home Assistant long-lived access token), `BEACON_PASSWORD` (at least 16 characters), and `BEACON_HOST=0.0.0.0`. `BEACON_PARENT_PIN` (6–8 digits) and `BEACON_BLOCKED_ENTITIES` (CSV of exact HA entity IDs) are optional and default to blank; a blank blocklist blocks no entities. The token remains server-side.

```bash
docker run -d --name family --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 --env-file /path/to/family.env \
  -v family-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/f1f1f1f1f1f1/family:vX.Y.Z
```

Replace `vX.Y.Z` with an available version tag. Browse `http://127.0.0.1:3000` locally; for other devices use an **HTTPS reverse proxy** in front of this loopback port. Log in with HTTP Basic username `beacon` and password `BEACON_PASSWORD`. With no parent PIN configured, authenticated users have parent access; if you set one, enter it to unlock for **10 minutes from PIN entry**. Never bind the container's plain-HTTP port to the LAN—even with Basic, the password is not encrypted in transit. See the [deployment guide](https://beacon-family-docs.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/deployment/) for a Compose example.

The release workflow refuses to overwrite an existing version tag. For content-addressed deployment, use `ghcr.io/f1f1f1f1f1f1/family@sha256:<index-digest>` instead; the [deployment guide](https://beacon-family-docs.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/deployment/) shows how to find and pull that digest.

Optional non-secret Docker env settings (`THEME`, `AUTO_DARK_MODE`, `WEATHER_ENTITY`, `PHOTO_DIRECTORY`, `PHOTO_INTERVAL`, `SCREEN_SAVER_TIMEOUT`) set startup display defaults. The server writes them to `runtime-config.js`; **it never includes HA credentials**. If an earlier build used `VITE_HA_TOKEN` or stored a long-lived HA token in the browser, [revoke and replace that token](SECURITY.md) even though the new server-backed app clears its local copy.

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/f1f1f1f1f1f1/Family.git
cd Family
npm ci
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000). This is a development server, not a standalone production deployment. Do not put an HA token in `VITE_HA_TOKEN` or any bundled environment variable; if testing a direct browser/native login, enter credentials during onboarding instead.

## Configuration

Beacon is configured through the Home Assistant add-on options panel:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `weather_entity` | `weather.home` | Home Assistant weather entity ID |
| `parent_pin` | blank (optional) | Set a 6–8 digit PIN to require parent unlock; blank grants parent access to authenticated ingress users |
| `blocked_entities` | blank (blocks none) | Optional comma-separated exact HA entity IDs to deny (e.g. `switch.garage,todo.private`) |
| `airplay` | `true` | The AirPlay receiver ([docs/airplay.md](docs/airplay.md)); `false` turns it off |
| `airplay_name` | `Family` | The name iPhones, iPads and Macs show for it |
| `airplay_password` | blank (optional) | A password devices must give to send to it (at least 4 characters); blank lets any device on the network |

Additional settings (themes, family members, chores, calendar sources, list providers) are configured through the Beacon UI or the supported non-secret Docker env defaults above. Add-on HA access uses a server-side Supervisor token and Home Assistant ingress; `runtime-config.js` never contains an HA token.

## Why Beacon?

- **Free & open source** — no subscriptions, no cloud accounts, no vendor lock-in
- **Private by design** — HA credentials stay on the server in add-on/Docker mode; HA integrations (for example, Google Tasks) may contact external services
- **Home Assistant native** — deep integration with calendars, media players, lists, weather, and more
- **Flexible deployment** — Supervisor-built add-on or versioned standalone Docker image for HA Core
- **Fully themeable** — 8+ themes with automatic dark mode
- **Voice & LLM ready** — MCP server, voice API, and HA custom sentences for hands-free control
